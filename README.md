## About the project
This is a Symfony project. It is a social network similar to Facebook. In this social network you can create an account with unique nickname and unique email. You can fill your profile and upload photos to custom your profile as you like.
On the other hand, you will be able to follow friends, like and comment the posts of your friends and chat with them.
